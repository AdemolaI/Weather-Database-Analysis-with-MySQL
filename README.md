# Weather-Database-Analysis-with-MySQL

In this project the weather database was explored using MySQL. There are 5 sessions with different questions answered based on the data from the database which include;

- cat_locations
- metoffice_dailyweatherdata
- weathertype
- zones
- timezone among other tables in the database.

The questions in the weather_db_script were answered using different methods like common table expressions, JOINS (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) etc.

We also connected R to MySQL to explore the weather database as seen in the MySQL_Connector_R_Prog.R and MySQL_Connector_R_Prog.pdf file.

Similarly, python was connected to MySQL as seen in the MySQL_Connector_Python.ipynb.
